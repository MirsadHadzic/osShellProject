<h1>Project shell</h1>
<h2>task 1.1: Shell interface</h2>
<p>
<b>Basic</b>
./task1, first when you try to run task1.c, you should first do gcc -Wall -o task1 task1.c
<br>
<b>Advanced</b>
It is called by executing this command in shell PS1="\$whoami@\$(hostname):~\$". The example of that can be seen in Screenshot(91).png and Screenshot(92).png.

<h2>task 1.2: Shell programs/commands</h2>
<p>
<b>Basic</b>
For the basic part, you can see the implementation of these commands in Screenshot(76).png, Screenshot(77).png and Screenshot(78).png. proba dictionary is the example of creating dictionary using mkdir.
  <br>
<b>Intermediate</b>
For the advanced part, you can see the implementation of these commands in Screenshot(79).png and Screenshot(80).png. project/explanation.txt is the text explanation of what these flags mean.
  <br>
<b>Advanced</b>
For the advanced part, ypu can see the implementation of these commands in Screenshot(80).png, Screenshot(81).png and Screenshot(82).png. For this task we used two .txt files, proba_piping.txt and proba_piping_dva.txt. We have seent what happens when we allow piping or redirecting output to a text file. We understood how to overwrite or append to a file.

<h2>task 1.3: System calls</h2>
<p>
<b>Basic</b>
./fork, first when you try to run fork_example.c, you should first do gcc -Wall -o fork fork_example.c, an example of that can be seen in Screenshot(83).png and Screenshot(84).png.
./wait, first when you try to run wait_example.c, you should first do gcc -Wall -o wait wait_example.c, an example of that can be seen in Screenshot(84).png and Screenshot(85).png.
exec_example.c is a failed example, you should look for EXEC.c and execDemo.c where in these two file an exec call is being shown. ./EXEC and ./execDemo, as always you should first do these things gcc -Wall -o EXEC EXEC.c and gcc -Wall -o execDemo execDemo.c to compile it. You should see an example of that in Screenshot(86).png and Screenshot(87).png. 
<br>
<b>Intermediate</b>
./vfork, first when you try to run vfork_example.c, you should first do gcc -Wall -o vfork vfork_example.c, an example of that can be seen in Screenshot(87).png and Screenshot(88).png.
./execl, first when you try to run execl_example.c, you should first do gcc -Wall -o execl execl_example.c, an example of that can be seen in Screenshot(88).png and Screenshot(89).png.
<br>
 <b>Additionally</b> 
    ./forkbomb, first when you try to run forkbomb.c, you should first do gcc -Wall -o forkbomb forkbomb.c, an example of that can be seen in Screenshot(89).png and Screenshot(90).png.

<p>./color, first when you try to run color.c, you should first do gcc -Wall -o color color.c to compile it.</p>
