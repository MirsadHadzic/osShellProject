A system cal allows user-level processes to request services from the operating system, such as 
accessing hardware or managing files. When a user-level process invokes a system call, control 
transitions from user mode to kernel mode to execute the requested operation. The kernel, operating
with higher privileges, fulfills the system call request by performing the necessary operations. 
Once the system call is completed, control returns to the user-level process, which continues its
execution. System calls enforce isolation and protection mechanisms, ensuring that user-level 
processes cannot directly access critical system resources.
