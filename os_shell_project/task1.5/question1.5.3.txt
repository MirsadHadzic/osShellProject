A: In the child process, when it is scheduled next, the value of the variable 'a' will be 5. This is
because the changes made to the variable 'a' in the parent process after forking ('a' = 6) do not
affect the child process. Each process, including the parent and child, has its own separate memnory
space, and changes made by one process do not affect the memory of other processes.

B: The attempt to read from the file descriptor in the child process will fail. This is because the 
parent process closed the file descriptor ('close(fd);') before the child process was scheduled for
the first time. When a file descriptor is closed in a parent process, it is also closed in all its 
child processes. Therefore, the 'read()' function in the child process will encounter an error when 
attempting to read from the closed file descriptor.
