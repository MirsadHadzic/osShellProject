uptime is to show system update
sl is a joke wheere locomotice shows and you need to install it using sudo
apt install sl, and run in terinal by just typing sl

okay, so the next thing we have done is intermadiate task for 1.2 shell progs

ls -la 

ls is to list directory contents, -l flag, it is to diplay detailed info
about files, including permissions, owner, group, size and modification time.

-a flag is to display hidden files

for example ls -l /path/to/directory

mkdir command is to create a directory, we can add an option to create parent
directories if they don't exist -p flag
-m is to add an option to set permissions for the created directory
